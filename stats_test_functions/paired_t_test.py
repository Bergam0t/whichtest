This is the fundamental requirement for a Paired t-Test, meaning that each subject in one sample corresponds to a subject in the other sample. Common scenarios include before-and-after measurements on the same subjects (e.g., pre-test and post-test scores) or measurements on matched pairs (e.g., siblings or twins).",
        'Scale of measurement': "The data must be measured at least at the interval level, which allows for the use of addition and subtraction operations. Common types of data suitable for a Paired t-Test include continuous data such as weights, scores, or times.",
        'Normal Distribution of Differences': "The differences between the paired samples should follow a normal distribution. This assumption is crucial for the validity of the test. If the sample size is small and the distribution of differences is not normal, the test might not be the appropriate choice.",
        'No Outliers': "The paired differences should not have outliers. Outliers can significantly affect the mean and standard deviation, which are critical for the t-test, potentially leading to misleading results.",
